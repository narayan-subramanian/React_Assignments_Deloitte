Conditional rendering in React refers to the ability to render different components or elements based on certain conditions. This allows you to dynamically control what is displayed to the user based on the state of your application, user input, or other factors.

There are several ways to implement conditional rendering in React:
Using Conditional Statements:
You can use JavaScript conditional statements such as if, else if, and else within your JSX code to conditionally render components or elements.

Using the Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
The conditional (ternary) operator condition ? trueValue : falseValue can be used to render different components or elements based on a condition.


Using Logical && Operator for Short-Circuit Evaluation:
You can use the logical && operator for short-circuit evaluation to conditionally render components or elements. This is useful when you want to render something only if a certain condition is true


Using Conditional Rendering with State:
You can use state to control conditional rendering based on user interactions or changes in application state.
